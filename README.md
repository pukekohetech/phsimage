## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Camera Not Working?**
  - Ensure permissions are granted and tap “Enable Camera” again.
  - Check device settings or try another browser/device.
- **Can’t Share?**
  - Some browsers (e.g., desktop Firefox) don’t support file sharing. Use “Download” and attach manually.

  - Double-check that you’ve entered a student name and selected a teacher.
- **Offline Issues?**
